# Aquarium Yeast Display Workflow

A workflow for doing several types of yeast display experiments using Aquairum. Originally developed for [massively parallel measurement of protein stability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706065), but can be used for protein (e.g., antibody) binding, promoter discovery, and other library sorting applications in yeast. 

## Required libraries
* [Standard Libraries](https://github.com/klavinslab/standard-libraries)
* [Flow Cytometry](https://github.com/klavinslab/flow-cytometry)

## Associated software
[Menagerie](https://github.com/klavinslab/menagerie) was originally developed for [automated planning](https://github.com/klavinslab/menagerie#plan-a-protein-stability-experiment) of this workflow.
